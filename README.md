pokenyms
========

Minimal work prototype for our team to play around with.
I wrote this with Python 2.7.2 but didn't use any special libraries
so it should be compatible further back.

### To Install

Just clone the repo. You will need Python installed to play.

    git clone https://github.com/siramix/pokenyms.git

### To Play It
You can either run this in TRAIN mode or PLAY mode.

#### TRAIN:
    /usr/bin/python pokenyms.py TRAIN

This mode will present you with one training anagram. Play
through this first to get familiar with the way the game
works.


#### PLAY:
    /usr/bin/python pokenyms.py PLAY

This mode will go through all the anagrams I entered into
the prototype.  Only do this once you've trained...it's
not for the faint of heart.

Decoy letters will be shown.
Related words are very difficult.


#### PLAY2:
    /usr/bin/python pokenyms.py PLAY2

This mode will go through anagrams I copied from buzzwords.
I think it ends up being much more fun than the normal play mode.

No decoys.
Related words are related, but entered manually.
