pokenyms
========

Minimal work prototype for our team to play around with.
I wrote this with Python 2.7.2 but didn't use any special libraries
so it should be compatible further back.

You can either run this in TRAIN mode or PLAY mode.

### TRAIN:
**py pokenyms.py TRAIN**

This mode will present you with one training anagram. Play
through this first to get familiar with the way the game
works.


### PLAY:
**py pokenyms.py PLAY**

This mode will go through all the anagrams I entered into
the prototype.  Only do this once you've trained...it's
not for the faint of heart.
